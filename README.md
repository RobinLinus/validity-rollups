# zkRollup research library

This research library contains resources I will be using to inform a report on zkRollups that I am producing as part of the Human Rights Foundation's [ZK-Rollup Research Fellowship](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1507069251047215112). Pull requests adding related and useful resources are appreciated!
